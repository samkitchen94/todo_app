# Todo List App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview
This is a simple todo list app to teach myself the basics of React. I've used React Native previously for my final project but never React, so it was interesting to see the similarities and differences between the two. Users can add todos, delete todos and cross off todos when they are completed.

I learnt a lot about styling and CSS during this project. I also learnt a lot about using uuid for generating unique id's for different objects that need to be stored, this was really useful and I'll definitiely be using this more in the future. 

This project uses a fake REST API from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com], to explore how this user interface could interact with a backend server that contains todos. Using this I learnt a lot about get, post and delete responses using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), a promise based HTTP client that can be used in both the browser and node.js. Another really helpful tool that I'll be using again! 

## Next Steps
Now that I've refreshed myself on the basics I'll be looking to add my own back end server in this, with a database to store todos etc. I'll probably try and use a database I haven't used before such as Firebase or Mongo DB for this, as well as node.js for the back end. I'll probably try and add some testing using Jest and deploy it on heroku.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
